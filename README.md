1. The Pixel Tracker software is designed to help you find exact colour(s) in any image. Pixel Tracker is an intelligent agent capable of selecting any area determined by the user in an image and list all the detailed colours in it accordingly. The colour values shown in the pallet models are such as RGB and HEX, which can help anyone in finding the exact matching colour and the desired pallet model.

2. The main advantage of Pixel Tracker is that a list of colours can lead you to a bigger range of similar colours, more model pallets, while still being a simple/minimalist and useful software. Pixel Tracker is a lightweight software, the performance of the algorithm can enhance the performance inside a complex software as it can take just a few minutes to evaluate a big picture.

3. On the demonstration day the demonstrator will select an image and an area in the image. The Pixel Tracker Software will then create a grid/list with all colours found in that range presenting to you the colours in different pallet models. The demonstrator can then, for instance, copy the colour code and use it in any software for manipulating colours/ images.

4. Pixel Tracker hopes to improve its’ algorithms in the future so that it can evaluate images at a faster pace and accommodate very large images. This can be referred to as the ‘big picture’ and vision of Make Colour’s regard towards Pixel Tracker. The big picture also holds stronger validation techniques and multi-platform support. Stronger validation is required to ensure that only accepted image files with specific properties can be evaluated. Multi-platform support is required as Pixel Tracker currently solely runs as a Windows form executable. Web platforms will be the primary focus when developing future versions of Pixel Tracker.
